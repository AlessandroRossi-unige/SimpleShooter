Things included in this project from the ORIGINAL:
- A working character capable of all movements
- Working animations from an Animation blueprint and BlendSpace, including animations for jumping and shooting 
- A simple AI that follows the player, shoots at him and investigates locations using Behaviour Trees
- A working gun that deals damage
- A custom game mode
- A custom UI for the player
- Almost all of the gameplay variables are customizable from the BP editor
- Worked with animation states

Things that I added and fixed:
- Added multiple enemies, including a "boss"
- Added a weapon switching mechanic with included animation
- Added a Shotgun as secondary weapon (press TAB), this has a spread and shoots more than one bullet per shot
- Added health regen to make the game a bit easier
- Added an objective counter
- Fixed minor bugs and some refactoring
